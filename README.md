# 3D printable PCB holder for hand assembly of your electronics projects
Do you ever assemble by your own hands / solder your own electronics designs, printed circuit boards, Arduino shields or something similar, and you were on your own? No one else around?

For tasks like these, one could use a so called helping hand. *Helping Hands* are usually made of metal and have a pinch to fix whatever you need the *helping hand* to hold for you. The pinch can be rotated and there you go. Only, usually, our *helping hands* got us into trouble: 

* they lose their stability, the more so, the bigger and heavier our PCBs were
* they are unable to hold some of our stuff from the start, actually
* usually you need more than one
* it's not always easy to use them in certain difficult situations
* they tend to wiggle and move when you don't like it the least
* also, as they get older, they tend to hold less and less in a steady way

So we came up with a 3D design so we could print out our own PCB holder. It fasts to your PCB on two sides, so it holds it better and more strictly (which is useful when soldering). You can turn the PCB in different angles and also fix it to the choosen angle best fitting your needs.

Our 3D printable *PCB holder* looks like this:

Putting it all together, it looks like this:

The files to print in 3D printer are in /3D-print-files folder, including info on screws to use etc. The CAD files are in /CAD folder.

You have these parts to print:

- Carrier (1)
- Carrier2 (1)
- Screw (1)
- Tipp1 (2)
- Tipp2 (2)
- Spinner (1)
- Axes (1)
- Fixing Screw (2)
- Rail (4, if needed)

**How to put together:**

- Print all parts with your 3D printer
- put them together on a wooden board of  35cm X 13cm X 1cm
- if you use rails, you could even cut the board in half and lengthen it with further rails for bigger projects
- use screws to fix the printed part onto the board

**Printing instructions:**

- recommended infill density is 20% for Carrier1, Carrier2, Axes, Screw, Spinner, rails
- recommended infill density is 100% for all other parts

We suggest using these screws for instance: (specific screws will follow, but self-piercing screws / wood screws are bes
t, s. 'screws.txt' in folder /3D-print-files).

In case you have some obstacle where the *PCB holder* touches the PCB, we have two different sort of pinch holders, called Tipp1 and Tipp2. Just turn the PCB around and see if you can hold it the other way around.

![Tipp1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88fbcaad-edb4-42ef-a14a-199c0dff042c)

*Tipp1 for when the borders of your PCB are free of any obstacles*

![Tipp2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/527f5a81-7d79-41fa-bcd4-3389fec19f2c)

*Tipp2 for when there is an obstacle right where you want to hold the PCB*
