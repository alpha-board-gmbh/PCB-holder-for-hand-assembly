# 3D printable PCB holder for hand assembly of your electronics projects
Ever had to hand assemble your own electronics design, printed circuit boards, Arduino shields or something similar, and you were on your own? For tasks like these, one could use a so called helping hand. *Helping Hands* are usually made of metal, have a pinch to fix whatever you need the *helping hand* to hold for you. The pinch can be rotated and there you go. Only, usually, the helping hands get you into trouble: 

* they lose their stability
* they are unable to hold some stuff from the start
* usually you need more than one
* it's not easy to use them in certain difficult situations
* they tend to wiggle and move when you don't like it the least

So we came up with a 3D design so we could print out our own PCB holder. The 3D printable device looks like this:
